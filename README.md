## Note About Fonts

Full list of Fonts and their Authors: [List of Supported Fonts](#list-of-supported-fonts)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All fonts in the demo are marked as **Freeware**.  
> However, it is strongly recommended to review the README file of any font you intend to use.

The **HTML Diagram** itself does not include any fonts, as you can check in the [npm package files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-diagram?activeTab=code) of the `html-diagram` package.

However, to ensure proper display, users needs to pick some chess font for rendering a diagram. For this demo, I've used **Freeware** fonts from the wonderful [Nørresundby Chess Club](https://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm).

All fonts used in the demo are located in [./public/fonts](https://github.com/dragunovartem99/html-diagram/tree/main/public/fonts) directory. Each subdirectory follows this structure:

```
📂 Diagram<font-name>
├── 📄 Diagram<font-name>.woff2
├── 📄 ORIGINAL_FONT.ttf
└── 📄 ORIGINAL_README.txt (if available)
```

### woff2 versions

To achieve minimum file size and consistency, each original font is accompanied by a `woff2` version. The `woff2` files reuse the following glyphs: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn, and empty square.

No modifications have been made to the design of the original glyphs.

The `woff2` version remaps pieces into the following:

| Board Object | On Light | On Dark |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| White King   | K        | k       |
| White Queen  | Q        | q       |
| White Rook   | R        | r       |
| White Bishop | B        | b       |
| White Knight | N        | n       |
| White Pawn   | P        | p       |
| Black King   | Ц        | ц       |
| Black Queen  | Ф        | ф       |
| Black Rook   | Л        | л       |
| Black Bishop | С        | с       |
| Black Knight | К        | к       |
| Black Pawn   | П        | п       |
| Emptiness    | +        | -       |

> The `woff2` versions were created with FontForge (version: 20230101), using encoding ISO 8859-5 (Cyrillic).

## Basic Usage

### 1. Installation

```shell
npm install html-diagram
```

### 2. JavaScript

Import the `HTMLDiagram` class; then use it to create custom HTML element:

```js
import { HTMLDiagram } from "html-diagram";
customElements.define("my-diagram", HTMLDiagram)
```

[Learn more about "customElements" on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements)

### 3. CSS

Pick the chess font you like; then define it in CSS.

After you've read [note about fonts](#note-about-fonts), you can look in [./public/fonts](https://github.com/dragunovartem99/html-diagram/tree/main/public/fonts) directory, and pick something you like.

In this example, we'll use the lovely "Adventurer" font by chess fonts _champion_ - Armando H. Marroquin:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Diagram Adventurer";
    src: "<your-path>/DiagramAdventurer.woff2";
}
```

Then, you must tell your diagram to use this font. This is achieved by using CSS variable:

```css
my-diagram {
    --diagram-font: "Diagram Adventurer";
}
```

### 4. HTML

Use element on your page

```html
<!-- empty board -->
<my-diagram></my-diagram>

<!-- starting position -->
<my-diagram fen="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"></my-diagram>
```
